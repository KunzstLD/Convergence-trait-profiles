```

### Goal of this analysis:

-   Step 1) Cluster taxa in trait databases according to their trait profiles to obtain groups of taxa with similar trait profiles (= trait profile groups)

-   Step 2) Extract those traits that drive the clustering/are responsible for the grouping of the taxa in groups of similar trait profiles

-   Two analyses are planned:

-   Analysis A) Comparison between Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

    -   Aggregation to family level required because of varying taxonomic resolutions between trait databases

    -   Subset of grouping features/traits that are present in all databases (feeding mode, locomotion, respiration, body size, body form, reproduction/oviposition, voltinism)

-   Analysis B) Comparison between major climatic regions of Europe and North America

    -   Occurrence data for Europe based on Ecoregions

    -   Occurrence data for North America from recently published CONUS trait database. Occurences are described for genera.

    -   Hence, aggregation of trait information to Genus level required

### Data analysis and current challenges

-   Data analysis:

    -   For Step 1) Hierarchical cluster analysis:

        -   Traits are expressed as affinities based on fuzzy coding

        -   Normalised to a range between $[0-1]$

        -   Distance matrix based on **Orloci's Chord distance** (= Euclidean distance after scaling vector length to 1) for fuzzy coded traits

            -   Suitable for proprotional data

            -   ?Species having different total sums of trait affinities

            -   Joint absences

        -   TODO: binary distances

### Data availability

#### Information on climate regions in Europe

-   Climate regions for European invertebrates have been assigned according to their occurrence in different ecoregions (described in the freshwaterecology database, not all species are described). We used:

    -   The KÃ¶ppen-Geiger classification from: <https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018214>

    -   And ecoregions maps based on: <https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ecoregions-for-rivers-and-lakes>

    -   Major climate regions used: polar, cold, temperate, arid

    -   Most taxa occur in multiple climate regions. I just used a subset of those taxa that occurred in one climateregion, and taxa were \> 50 % of the species described occur in one climateregion. After selection, taxa were aggregated to genus-lvl. This resulted in 109 genera distributed as follows: 45 cold, 1 polar, 63 temperate. The genus from the polar region was not considered.

    -   (Some of the genera were classified into their dominant climateregion based on one or two species because more information was not available in the freshwaterecology database)

#### Load original trait data with climate classification ------------

# Read in data
trait_subsets <- readRDS(
  file.path(
    getwd(),
    "Comparison_between_climatic_zones",
    "Cache",
    "trait_subsets.rds"
  )
)

# Omit data we (for now) do not consider (development)
trait_subsets[, c("dev_hemimetabol", "dev_holometabol") := NULL]

# Genera per climateregion
genus_cr <- trait_subsets[, .(`Nr. of species` = .N), 
                          by = .(genus, climateregion)]

# Calculate rel. distribution according to major climatic regions
genus_cr[, rel_distrib := `Nr. of species`/sum(`Nr. of species`), 
         by = genus]

# Genera only occurring in one climateregion: 37
genera_onecr <- genus_cr[rel_distrib == 1, ]
genera_onecr[trait_subsets,
             `:=`(family = i.family,
               order = i.order), 
               on = "genus"]
knitr::kable(genera_onecr, caption = "Genera that occur only in one climate region")

# All genera used for subsequent analyses
genera_cr_final <- genus_cr[rel_distrib > 0.5 & climateregion != "polar", ] 
genera_cr_final[trait_subsets,
                `:=`(family = i.family,
                     order = i.order),
                on = "genus"]

knitr::kable(genera_cr_final, 
             caption = "Genera used for subsequent analyses")
```

#### European trait data for cold and temperate climate regions

Very little information is available for body size and body form traits. I would not consider these traits for the subsequent analysis. Generally, trait information is incomplete for this dataset, which poses the question how to handle missing values/NAs:

-   **Q1**: Should I not consider entries with NAs, leave them as they are, or substitute with Zeros?

    -   If I leave them as they are taxa the distance measure will be calculated based on the amount of available trait information. For example, if Genera A has information for three grouping features, all 3 are considered in the calculation of the distance matrix, even when compared to a Genera B which only has information for one grouping feature (standardisation of site vector lengths)

    -   If I substitute NAs with Zeros, this will change the distances when calculating the distance matrix (see example Chord distance taxon 1 and 4). Replacing NAs with zeros seems to be wrong from an ecological standpoint, because this indicates that a particular taxon would not express certain traits.

```

After calculating the distance matrix for the climate region cold, a lot of NAs are introduced into the distance matrix. Removing these leads to very little data that is left for the cold climateregion (basically 8 genera)
